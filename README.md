# HR Attrition Analytics
### Project Overview
I have created a HR ATTRITION Analytics Dashboard by using Excel. The dashboard shows detailed Attrition analysis of Employees from an organisation. 
I used complex parameters to drill down in worksheet and customization using filters and slicers.
I created connection, joins new tables, calculations to manipulate data and user driven parameters for visualizations.
Skills: Advance Excel
